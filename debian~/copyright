For dh_make to find the package name and version, the current directory
needs to be in the format of <package>-<version>.  Alternatively use the
_-p flag using the format <name>_<version> to override it.
The directory name you have specified is invalid!

Your current directory is:
/home/sitnin/Projects/bcrypt/debian
Perhaps you could try going to directory where the sources are?

Please note that this change is necessary ONLY during the initial
Debianization with dh_make.  When building the package, dpkg-source
will gracefully handle almost any upstream tarball.
